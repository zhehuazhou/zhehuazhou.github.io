I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), under the mentorship of Prof. Lei Ma and Prof. Zhan Shu. I received my Ph.D. from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) in 2022, where I specialized in automatic control and robotics under the supervision of Prof. Martin Buss.

My research interests include learning-based control, safe reinforcement learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches, and their applications in robotics and cyber-physical systems. I am focused on developing intelligent and robust AI-enabled autonomous and robotic systems with safety and reliability guarantees, ensuring their applicability to a wide range of complex real-world tasks and scenarios.
